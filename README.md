This is a set of pdf beamer slides which I am using in my Boston College 2026 course, Computational Methods in Macroeconomics.  I will also upload some spreadsheet examples as well as python/julia and dynare code examples.
While these are available for Boston College students on Canvas, I invite others to make use of this material and of course welcome comments and suggestions for improvement.
